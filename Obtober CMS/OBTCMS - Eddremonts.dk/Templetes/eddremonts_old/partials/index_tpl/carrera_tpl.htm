                       <p> I have eight years of work experience and my former colleagues all know me as a helpful, hard working
                        and inspiring person. In the University I worked one year as a developer and the last two years as a
                        manager. It was a challenging and collaborative environment, and a positive starting point for my
                        career. My first position as a graduated engineer was at ONEI (The National Office of Statistics and
                        Information) where I worked as a computer specialist and where I made two applications.

                        Most recently, I worked in GEOCUBA where I made 5 applications and a framework(ArtKit) with
                        two colleagues. In May 2014 I started my own project, Viruta Estudio Creativo, where I created
                        systems for different Cuban companies like

                         <p>I'm a skilled and creative web developer focused on Drupal, Joomla, PHP, JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5,
                        looking for a challenging position creating useful software. I'm eager to work with new ideas and

                        I enjoy difficult problems as they give me an opportunity to demonstrate my flexibility
                        and ability to observe the projects from another angle in order to come to a solution.</p>
